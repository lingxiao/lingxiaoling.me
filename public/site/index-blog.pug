I argue the true priority of higher education is not information dissemination but rather ideological assimilation, so that graduates may be trusted to exercise their intellectual freedom within the narrow political framework that serves the current military and financial-industrial complex. Thus course work is merely the context in which free-thinking minds are re-educated through labor, and every exam is an ideological fit test masquerading as an intellectual exercise. Seen in this light, technology cannot improve education unless it redefines the social contract between the Worker, the Firm, and the State.'
