        \item {Major part of a multiple year study to gather adjectives in the paraphrase database, cluster them based on semantic similarity, and rank adjectives within each cluster by emotional intensity, with application to intelligent dialogue agents.}
        % 
        \item {Led the ranking effort by first successfully reproducing the state of the art study by Bansal and de Melo (2013), then improved it by 7.5\% (measured by Kendall's tau score) on de Melo’s test set, and suppressed de Melo by over 400\% on new test set procured from Amazon Mechanical Turks.}
        % 
        \item {Researched, developed and tested multiple ranking methods including: page rank, personalized page rank, various integer linear programming formulations, elastic net regression, logistic regression with l1 and l2 penalties, and incorporated prior information using beta-binomial model.}
