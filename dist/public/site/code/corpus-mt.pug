                          | I was part of a multi-year project led by <a target='_blank' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendan-d-callahan-a6473327/'>Brendan Callahan </a>, in collaboration with <a target='_blank' href='https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~johnhew/'> John Hewitt </a> and  <a target='_blank' href = 'http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~derry/'>Derry Wijyaya</a>, supervised by <a target ='_target' href='http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/'>Chris Callison-Burch</a>.  In this project, we introduce a new large scale multilingual corpus of labeled images collected to facilitate research into learning translations through visual similarity. We have collected 100 images for up to 10,000 words in each of 100 foreign languages, plus images for each of their translations into English. In addition to the images, we collected the text from the web pages where each of the images appeared. Our dataset contains 35 million images and web pages, totaling 25 terabytes of data. We also release vectors represent each image using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features, color histograms and convolutional neural network (CNN) based features.
