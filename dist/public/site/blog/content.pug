		//- right now what we have is a very limited templating langauge, 
		//- it doesnt do quotes, or integrate big pictures well.
		//- it doesn't do subheaders
		//- at this point the biggest risk is not being able to deploy this stuff on mobile 
		//- so the next to do is to deply and watch how it works on mobile
		//- first deploy the old website that we know works
		//- if that doesnt work then deploy a really simple one
		//- so the problem is with this project, because the other one works ... 
		//- we can make a new directory and add things in one at a time
